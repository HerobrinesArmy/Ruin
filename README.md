Repo

You're damned right it's optional, Github. What do I look like, someone who has time to come up with descriptions for things?

## About
This repo is the home of Ruin. Ruin is the RFC-like system that is being developed for Herobrine's Army. It was decided that
ChaOS, Entropy and Discord needed some standardisation, with an RFC-like system having the perfect functionality to provide said
standardisation.

It is hosted at [Lupus's Server][0xha-data] and is currently being worked on by Phoenix and Lupus.
